 # Team Aaron Svendsen - No Teammate, was away this weekend
 
## Description
I read more Corda documentaion about key concepts.I continued using Coarda. I did another tutorial. 
The tutorial involved building nodes: Notaries, parties, and network nodes. These nodes could communicate with each other with IOU transactions. 
These transactions could be initiated with commands or through a web interface. Since Corda runs on JVM and was written in Kotlin,
I learned Kotlin and make a Android App using Kotlin.

## Learned

I learned how to run nodes on the Corda network, Kotlin syntax and a bit of Android. I learned a little about xml.


## What didn't Work

I tried changed the some of the Corda example files but I couldn't get it to work. Using Corda isn't trivial
